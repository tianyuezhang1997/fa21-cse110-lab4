1. **values added:  20**
2. **final result:  20**
3. **values added:  20**
4. **Error**   
   Because " result " was declared by the keyword " let ", thus the scope of " result " was within the if statement.
5. **Error**  
   Because " result " was declared by the keyword " const ", thus the value of " result " could not be reassigned, which caused the program crashing at line 7. 
6. **Error**  
   Same reason as question 5.
